Blackjack with Reinforcement Learning
=========
- Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation 
Evaluated the policy "Hit (ask for a new card) if sum of cards is below 17, and Stand (switch to dealer) otherwise" using the Monte Carlo method -- namely, learned the utilities for each state under the policy.

- Temporal-Difference Policy Evaluation
Evaluated the policy "Hit (ask for a new card) if sum of cards is below 17, and Stand (switch to dealer) otherwise" using the Temporal-Difference method. 

- Q-Learning
Implemented the Q-learning algorithm. After learning, when the user plays manually, the Q values will be displayed for each action (two choices) to guide the user.
